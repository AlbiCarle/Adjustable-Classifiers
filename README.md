# Adjustable-Classifiers

Supervised classification recognizes patterns in the
data to separate classes of behaviors. Canonical solutions
contain misclassification errors that are intrinsic to the numerical approximating nature of
machine learning. The data analyst may minimize the classification error on a class at the expense of increasing the
error of the other classes. The error control of such a design phase is
often done in a heuristic manner.
